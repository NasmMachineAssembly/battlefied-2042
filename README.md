# Battlefield 2042

An internal cheat for Battlefield 2042 that hooks the D3D12 Present Scene to render.

## Problems

It's from the beta days, I haven't really worked on it since November, 2021. Outdated.

## Usage

1. Change the driver inside of any public kernel injector ([Face Injector](https://github.com/ALEHACKsp/face-injector-v2-1/tree/main/face_injector_v2) or [Modmap](https://github.com/btbd/modmap/tree/master/modmap))
2.  Compile in `x64 Release` & inject.

## Note

This was the 2nd internal I've ever made so the coding practices are horrible, good old beta bf days.
